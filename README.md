# PracticalExam
Final

Problems: The main problem I had was with the navigation drawer. It was something I had never built before
I tried to read the documents but they only helped me so much. Also the test was tons of XML layout which I am also
not very comfortable with. I was able to finish most of the exam except for implementing the on clicks for the
navigation drawer.
In the google docs they use an onclicklistener but I saw other code online using a navigation view widget. But I didn't
have enough time to implement. I wanted to turn in a working project.
